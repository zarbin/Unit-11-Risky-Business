### Resampling
  * Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
    ```
    Combination (Over and Under) Sampling - SMOTEEN
    Balance Accuracy Score = .7975
    ```

  * Which model had the best recall score?
    ```
    SMOTE Oversampling
    Recall score: avg/total = .88
    ```
  * Which model had the best geometric mean score?
    ```
    Combination (Over and Under) Sampling - SMOTEEN and SMOTE Oversampling
    Both had the same geometric mean score = .79
    ```
